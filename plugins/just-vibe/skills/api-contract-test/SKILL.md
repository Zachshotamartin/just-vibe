Verify provider and consumer expectations

## Choose this workflow

Use to implement consumer/provider contract checks; test-integration exercises broader dependency behavior.

Read [shared execution](../../references/execution.md) for context/mode/authority handling and [APIs methods](../../references/packs/api.md) for tool selection and operational details. Resolve these paths from this skill file; all runtime assets ship inside the plugin.

## Input and mode

Use the complete request appended to this invocation, preserving all constraints and references. Default mode: **apply**. Apply; provider/consumer expectations, versions, fixtures, and test environment.

interface definitions, producer/consumer source, authentication model, versioning constraints, and isolated test endpoints. External API calls must respect environment, credentials, rate limits, and side-effect scope.

- **Infer from evidence:** Read producer/consumer schemas, error contracts, auth conventions and known supported client versions.
- **Reasonable default:** Keep compatible response and pagination semantics where the brief does not request a breaking change.
- **Ask only when needed:** Ask when contract sources disagree or an unknown consumer changes compatibility; do not require live credentials to write or test an isolated client.

Declared evidence requirements: `project.read`. Use actual host discovery or adequate supplied artifacts; unavailable evidence remains blocked/unknown.

## Scope

Observable cross-boundary contracts; no reliance on live production state.

Apply: only the requested local changes and relevant isolated verification. Inspect/plan requests remain inspection/planning. External actions require their exact action and target in session authorization.

## Execute

1. Identify important assumptions, build provider/consumer assertions, control fixtures, verify valid and invalid exchanges, and integrate with relevant checks.
2. Derive assertions from actual consumer assumptions, control fixture identity and verify the real provider boundary when a safe environment exists.
## Technical method

- **Inspect:** Identify independently owned provider/consumer expectations and representative boundary fixtures.
- **Method:** Exercise real serialization and decoding with valid, absent, null, unknown-field and error cases; keep mocks scoped to what they establish.
- **Avoid misdiagnosis:** A provider-generated mock validating itself is circular evidence of compatibility.
- **Check the result:** Run a known incompatible response through the consumer and a valid control; record which real boundary and version were exercised.

## Read when relevant

- When a concrete decision or deliverable example would clarify this workflow: [APIs worked example](../../references/examples/api.md).


## Decision branches

- **When only mocks can run:** Report consumer behavior and mocked assumptions separately from provider conformance.

## Deliver and verify

- Contract tests, fixture provenance, and execution results.
- Contract cases, schema/semantic assertions and provider verification coverage.

Verify these observable conditions when applicable to the actual task; do not claim they were exercised from merely reading this file:

- Removing a required response field fails; implementation changes preserving the contract remain valid.

## Stop and recover

- Do not make mocks the sole evidence that the real provider conforms. Missing provider execution is a stated coverage gap.

## Example requests

- **Normal (apply):** Test invoice producer and consumer contracts against isolated fixtures.
- **edge (apply):** Test an API returning an optional field as null versus omitting it.
- **blocked (inspect):** Design contract checks with no provider runtime; do not equate a mock pass with compatibility.
