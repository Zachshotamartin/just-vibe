# llm-structured

Implement structured outputs, validation, and recovery

## Choose this workflow

Use for validated structured model output; api-client handles the provider transport boundary.

Read [shared execution](../../references/execution.md) for context/mode/authority handling and [LLMs and retrieval methods](../../references/packs/llm.md) for tool selection and operational details. Resolve these paths from this skill file; all runtime assets ship inside the plugin.

## Input and mode

Use the complete request appended to this invocation, preserving all constraints and references. Default mode: **apply**. Apply; output schema, provider capabilities, validation rules, consumers, and retry budget.

task definition, model/provider configuration, representative permitted data, versioned prompts/corpus where relevant, and explicit token/cost/latency limits for remote calls. Use current provider interfaces during implementation. Retrieved content and model-generated tool arguments remain untrusted.

- **Infer from evidence:** Read current prompt/tool schemas, retrieval boundaries, installed SDK/provider config and permitted examples without reading secret values.
- **Reasonable default:** Use mocked calls for local contract tests when remote access is absent; do not infer model quality from mocks.
- **Ask only when needed:** Ask for budget and permitted data/provider before a paid or external run if not already set; local prompt/tool implementation can proceed.

Declared evidence requirements: `ml.artifacts`. Use actual host discovery or adequate supplied artifacts; unavailable evidence remains blocked/unknown.

## Scope

Structured generation, semantic validation, refusal/incomplete handling, and bounded recovery.

Apply: only the requested local changes and relevant isolated verification. Inspect/plan requests remain inspection/planning. External actions require their exact action and target in session authorization.

## Execute

1. Define schema-compatible requests, validate outputs beyond parsing, separate refusal/truncation from malformed data, implement constrained retries, and test downstream consumption.
2. Resolve supported schema features, validate semantics after parsing and separate refusal, truncation, invalid structure and downstream business rejection.
## Technical method

- **Inspect:** Read the exact schema, provider support, refusal/truncation signals and downstream invariants.
- **Method:** Validate syntax, schema and business constraints separately; bound retries and return typed failure when recovery cannot establish validity.
- **Avoid misdiagnosis:** Valid JSON can contain fabricated IDs or inconsistent totals; filling required fields with invented defaults corrupts meaning.
- **Check the result:** Exercise malformed, schema-valid-but-semantic-invalid, refused and truncated responses alongside a valid control.

## Read when relevant

- When a concrete decision or deliverable example would clarify this workflow: [LLMs and retrieval worked example](../../references/examples/llm.md).


## Decision branches

- **When retries repeatedly fail the same constraint:** Stop at the cap with a typed error and retain diagnostics; never fabricate fields to satisfy the schema.

## Deliver and verify

- Structured-output integration, schemas, recovery behavior, and fixtures.
- Schema/validation contract and malformed, missing, refusal and truncation fixtures.

Verify these observable conditions when applicable to the actual task; do not claim they were exercised from merely reading this file:

- Syntactically valid but semantically invalid output is rejected; repeated failure terminates with a typed error.

## Stop and recover

- Never coerce fabricated fields into valid-looking data. Do not assume every provider supports identical schema features.

## Example requests

- **Normal (apply):** Implement schema validation and bounded recovery for invalid or truncated output.
- **edge (apply):** Extract records when output parses but contains impossible dates.
- **blocked (inspect):** Design structured output with unknown provider schema support; avoid assumed API flags.
