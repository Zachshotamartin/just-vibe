# backend-idempotency

Prevent duplicate effects from retries and repeated requests

## Choose this workflow

Use to make repeated operations produce the intended single effect; backend-concurrency covers broader interleavings.

Read [shared execution](../../references/execution.md) for context/mode/authority handling and [Backend methods](../../references/packs/backend.md) for tool selection and operational details. Resolve these paths from this skill file; all runtime assets ship inside the plugin.

## Input and mode

Use the complete request appended to this invocation, preserving all constraints and references. Default mode: **apply**. Apply; retried operation, effect boundary, request identity, and deduplication lifetime.

service source, data/interface contracts, framework/runtime versions, and test environment. Default apply operations target local code and isolated tests; live infrastructure/data mutations require their own requested scope.

- **Infer from evidence:** Trace service callers, request contracts, authorization, transactions, retries and existing test infrastructure.
- **Reasonable default:** Use the existing persistence and framework; isolate local tests from live services.
- **Ask only when needed:** Resolve ambiguous durability, duplication or consistency requirements before encoding them; absent production access does not prevent local implementation.

Declared evidence requirements: `project.read`. Use actual host discovery or adequate supplied artifacts; unavailable evidence remains blocked/unknown.

## Scope

Prevent duplicate effects for the specified operation, including concurrent duplicates.

Apply: only the requested local changes and relevant isolated verification. Inspect/plan requests remain inspection/planning. External actions require their exact action and target in session authorization.

## Execute

1. Define the business operation, key namespace, payload equivalence, validity/retention window and replay response. Include tenant and operation where they distinguish effects; specify how equal keys with different payloads or pending work are handled.
2. Validate the payload without permissive coercion where the contract requires exact types or bounds. Check ownership, funds/capacity and numeric limits at the boundary that protects against concurrent change.
3. When the effect and deduplication record share a database, make their success/failure atomic using the engine-supported transaction and uniqueness mechanism. Define transaction ownership and make identical concurrent requests converge on the original stored result.
4. For an external effect, walk the crash before send, timeout after possible success and failure before local recording. Use supported provider idempotency or durable reconciliation; a local key alone cannot prove exactly-once external execution.
5. Test equal replay, conflicting payload, separate tenants, simultaneous claims and failure after each durable step. Assert state, stored result and hook/provider call count; verify a retry after rollback can succeed without repeating a completed effect.
## Technical method

- **Inspect:** Identify key scope, normalized payload, unique storage constraint, external provider support and retention.
- **Method:** Atomically bind a key to payload and result; distinguish completed, in-progress and uncertain external outcomes with reconciliation.
- **Avoid misdiagnosis:** An in-memory map fails across processes; deleting a pending key after a timeout can permit a second charge.
- **Check the result:** Send concurrent equal requests and same-key different-payload requests, then interrupt after external success before local recording.

## Read when relevant

- When a concrete decision or deliverable example would clarify this workflow: [Backend worked example](../../references/examples/backend.md).
- The affected project uses Django / DRF: [Django / DRF](../../references/frameworks/django.md).
- The affected project uses FastAPI: [FastAPI](../../references/frameworks/fastapi.md).
- The affected project uses Spring Boot: [Spring Boot](../../references/frameworks/spring-boot.md).
- The task specifically involves kubernetes, readiness probe, rolling update; load only the matching method: [Kubernetes release and failure recovery](../../references/methods/kubernetes-release.md).
- The task specifically involves flox, uncloud, dev environment, reproducible environment; load only the matching method: [Flox, containers and reproducible development](../../references/methods/reproducible-environments.md).
- The task specifically involves tail latency, latency critical, p99, benchmark optimization; load only the matching method: [Latency budgets and performance experiments](../../references/methods/latency-systems.md).

## Decision branches

- **When the same key arrives with a different payload or while pending:** Return explicit conflict/pending behavior; do not execute another effect or replay an unrelated result.

## Deliver and verify

- Operation/key/payload contract, durable ownership and retention policy, failure-window table, and replay/conflict/concurrency/interruption evidence.

Verify these observable conditions when applicable to the actual task; do not claim they were exercised from merely reading this file:

- Equal replay performs no new effect; a conflicting payload cannot inherit an unrelated result. Local rollback removes both partial effects and the claim when the contract permits retry; uncertain external outcomes remain explicitly unresolved.

## Stop and recover

- Do not claim exactly-once external delivery without provider support or reconciliation. Cache-only deduplication needs durability justification.

## Example requests

- **Normal (apply):** Prevent duplicate payment credits from concurrent and reordered webhooks.
- **edge (apply):** Make payment creation safe when two equal requests arrive simultaneously.
- **blocked (inspect):** Design idempotency without provider deduplication support; identify reconciliation requirements.
