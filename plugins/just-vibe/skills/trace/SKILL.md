# trace

Follow a request, event, or data value through the system

## Choose this workflow

Use to follow one execution or data path across boundaries; map shows topology without reconstructing a particular flow.

Read [shared execution](../../references/execution.md) for context/mode/authority handling and [General methods](../../references/packs/general.md) for tool selection and operational details. Resolve these paths from this skill file; all runtime assets ship inside the plugin.

## Input and mode

Use the complete request appended to this invocation, preserving all constraints and references. Default mode: **inspect**. Inspect; request, event, identifier, or data value and optional environment/time window. Requires source or relevant sanitized telemetry.

Resolve the user brief and inspect the relevant project or supplied evidence. External capabilities are optional unless the selected action actually needs them.

- **Infer from evidence:** Resolve the named files, existing scripts, current task and earlier corrections from the conversation and repository.
- **Reasonable default:** Use the narrowest interpretation that completes a reversible local task; state a consequential assumption once.
- **Ask only when needed:** Ask when competing targets or incompatible success conditions would change the result; continue independent inspection first.

Declared evidence requirements: `project.read`. Use actual host discovery or adequate supplied artifacts; unavailable evidence remains blocked/unknown.

## Scope

One end-to-end execution/data path, including service boundaries; no new instrumentation by default.

No source changes in inspect/plan. Save only requested planning artifacts. A separately requested repair uses the relevant implementation workflow.

## Execute

1. Identify the entry point, follow transformations and dispatches, correlate available IDs, and mark async boundaries and missing spans.
2. Start from an identified input or correlation ID; record each hop's input, output, identity propagation and synchronous or asynchronous transition.
## Technical method

- **Inspect:** Locate entry point, transformations, asynchronous handoffs, identity propagation and terminal effects.
- **Method:** Follow one concrete request/value, recording boundaries and error branches with file or runtime evidence.
- **Avoid misdiagnosis:** A static call graph does not prove which branch executed; queue handoffs can change identity and ordering.
- **Check the result:** Reconcile the trace against one success and one failure observation, marking any inaccessible runtime segment.

## Read when relevant

- When a concrete decision or deliverable example would clarify this workflow: [General worked example](../../references/examples/general.md).


## Decision branches

- **When a queue or external service has no downstream evidence:** End the confirmed trace at that boundary and list the exact log or source needed to continue.

## Deliver and verify

- Ordered path with source/telemetry evidence, transformations, failure branches, and gaps.
- Hop table with ordering, payload transformations, evidence and gaps.

Verify these observable conditions when applicable to the actual task; do not claim they were exercised from merely reading this file:

- An async job is separated from its triggering request; an absent downstream log is reported as a gap rather than proof of success.

## Stop and recover

- Do not scan unrelated tenant data or infer causation from timestamp proximity alone.

## Example requests

- **Normal (inspect):** Trace an order from the checkout route through the payment job.
- **edge (inspect):** Trace a checkout request through a queued email and a failed payment callback.
- **blocked (inspect):** Trace only these supplied logs; downstream worker logs are unavailable.
