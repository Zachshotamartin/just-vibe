# ml-threshold

Choose thresholds against explicit costs or capacity limits.

## Choose this workflow

Use to choose a decision cutoff under explicit costs/capacity; ml-evaluate measures fixed behavior.

Read [shared execution](../../references/execution.md) for context/mode/authority handling and [ML evaluation methods](../../references/packs/ml-evaluation.md) for tool selection and operational details. Resolve these paths from this skill file; all runtime assets ship inside the plugin.

## Input and mode

Use the complete request appended to this invocation, preserving all constraints and references. Default mode: **plan**. Plan; scores/labels, explicit error costs or capacity, prevalence, and validation protocol.

**Pack prerequisites:** Frozen model/artifact, evaluation dataset identity, labels where needed, metric definitions, and task/operating context. Report sample counts and uncertainty appropriate to dependencies; avoid repeated test-set tuning. Exploratory findings need fresh confirmation before strong generalization claims.

- **Infer from evidence:** Read frozen model/data identities, metric definitions, denominators and supplied predictions; separate validation from test use.
- **Reasonable default:** Compute only supported metrics on permitted samples and label missing labels or subgroup coverage as unknown.
- **Ask only when needed:** Ask when the operating cost/threshold or population changes the evaluation decision; do not fabricate labels to avoid a question.

Declared evidence requirements: `ml.artifacts`. Use actual host discovery or adequate supplied artifacts; unavailable evidence remains blocked/unknown.

## Scope

Select an operating point or decision policy; no production activation.

No source changes in inspect/plan. Save only requested planning artifacts. A separately requested repair uses the relevant implementation workflow.

## Execute

1. Compare threshold tradeoffs, model workload/capacity, handle ties and uncertainty, choose using validation data, and reserve independent confirmation.
2. Compute validation tradeoffs with denominators and tie handling, translate them into expected workload under stated volume/prevalence and reserve independent confirmation.

## Technical method

- **Inspect:** Obtain score distribution, error costs, review capacity, protected requirements and selection data.
- **Method:** Choose an operating point using explicit constraints and uncertainty; keep threshold selection separate from final test reporting.
- **Avoid misdiagnosis:** A threshold maximizing F1 may violate a daily capacity or false-positive budget.
- **Check the result:** Compute the confusion matrix and workload at nearby thresholds, including tied scores and changing prevalence assumptions.

## Read when relevant

- When a concrete decision or deliverable example would clarify this workflow: [ML evaluation worked example](../../references/examples/ml-evaluation.md).


## Decision branches

- **When no agreed cost or capacity preference distinguishes options:** Present the tradeoff curve and the missing decision rather than selecting an arbitrary optimum.

## Deliver and verify

- Threshold recommendation, confusion/workload estimates, assumptions, and sensitivity.
- Threshold policy, expected workload assumptions and independent evaluation requirement.

Verify these observable conditions when applicable to the actual task; do not claim they were exercised from merely reading this file:

- A daily review cap is respected under declared volume assumptions; a changed prevalence is shown to affect workload/precision.

## Stop and recover

- Do not invent business costs or optimize against the held-out test set. Unresolved priorities yield a tradeoff curve rather than a forced value.

## Example requests

- **Normal (plan):** Choose validation thresholds when reviewers can inspect 200 transactions daily.
- **Edge (plan):** Select a daily review threshold with tied scores and a hard queue cap.
- **Blocked (inspect):** Compare cutoffs with unknown error costs; do not optimize on test labels.
