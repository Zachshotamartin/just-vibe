# vite-setup

Configure Vite for the framework and project requirements

## Choose this workflow

Use to add or repair Vite project wiring; vite-upgrade changes an existing version.

Read [shared execution](../../references/execution.md) for context/mode/authority handling and [Vite methods](../../references/packs/vite.md) for tool selection and operational details. Resolve these paths from this skill file; all runtime assets ship inside the plugin.

## Input and mode

Use the complete request appended to this invocation, preserving all constraints and references. Default mode: **apply**. Apply; framework, language, project location, deployment shape, and dependency constraints.

project manifests, lockfile, Vite/framework/plugin versions, and existing build scripts. Verify current version-specific documentation when changing configuration. Requested isolated verification may generate disposable build/cache artifacts; inspect their scripts first and preserve product files.

- **Infer from evidence:** Read manifests, lockfile, installed Vite/plugins, entry points, aliases, modes and current build scripts.
- **Reasonable default:** Preserve existing tooling and base-path conventions; in apply mode, make a local focused change when the brief identifies the behavior, and otherwise propose it.
- **Ask only when needed:** Ask if the intended serving subpath or deployment target cannot be inferred and would change generated URLs; do not ask for versions present in the lockfile.

Declared evidence requirements: `project.read`. Use actual host discovery or adequate supplied artifacts; unavailable evidence remains blocked/unknown.

## Scope

Vite configuration and required scripts/integration; no app redesign or unrelated toolchain replacement.

Apply: only the requested local changes and relevant isolated verification. Inspect/plan requests remain inspection/planning. External actions require their exact action and target in session authorization.

## Execute

1. Inspect existing setup, choose compatible plugins, configure development/build/preview scripts, preserve existing source, and validate basic development and production paths.
2. Inspect package manager, workspace root, framework plugin and Node support; preserve existing entry files and establish dev/build/preview paths using project conventions.
## Technical method

- **Inspect:** Inspect framework, installed Node/Vite/plugin versions, workspace scripts, module format and deployment base path.
- **Method:** Adapt the existing build convention; align dev entry, production output and asset resolution using supported version-specific settings.
- **Avoid misdiagnosis:** Copying a config for another major or adding a second package manager can create a setup that only works on one machine.
- **Check the result:** Verify dev startup, production build and a direct nested route against generated output with the chosen package manager.

## Read when relevant

- When a concrete decision or deliverable example would clarify this workflow: [Vite worked example](../../references/examples/vite.md).
- Creating, editing or reviewing frontend UI, copy, states or visual assets: [Frontend iconography](../../references/frontend-icons.md).

## Decision branches

- **When an existing app already has a bundler or non-root deployment path:** Plan an explicit transition and base-path handling rather than copying a new template over it.

## Deliver and verify

- Working setup, dependency/config changes, usage, and check results.
- Configuration/script changes and dev/production/subpath verification.

Verify these observable conditions when applicable to the actual task; do not claim they were exercised from merely reading this file:

- The existing app builds; deploying under the requested base path resolves assets correctly.

## Stop and recover

- Do not overwrite an existing project with a template. Respect no-new-dependency constraints and unsupported framework combinations.

## Example requests

- **Normal (apply):** Set up Vite for this existing React app without replacing source files.
- **edge (apply):** Configure Vite in an existing React workspace served under /dashboard/.
- **blocked (inspect):** Inspect setup requirements without installing dependencies or overwriting source.
