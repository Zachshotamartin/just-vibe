# vite-env

Check environment loading and exposure of server-only values

## Choose this workflow

Use for build mode, environment loading and client exposure; vercel-env checks deployment scope metadata.

Read [shared execution](../../references/execution.md) for context/mode/authority handling and [Vite methods](../../references/packs/vite.md) for tool selection and operational details. Resolve these paths from this skill file; all runtime assets ship inside the plugin.

## Input and mode

Use the complete request appended to this invocation, preserving all constraints and references. Default mode: **inspect**. Inspect; build mode, expected variable names, environment files, and exposure policy. Apply for a requested configuration fix without reading or printing secret values.

project manifests, lockfile, Vite/framework/plugin versions, and existing build scripts. Verify current version-specific documentation when changing configuration. Requested isolated verification may generate disposable build/cache artifacts; inspect their scripts first and preserve product files.

- **Infer from evidence:** Read manifests, lockfile, installed Vite/plugins, entry points, aliases, modes and current build scripts.
- **Reasonable default:** Preserve existing tooling and base-path conventions; in apply mode, make a local focused change when the brief identifies the behavior, and otherwise propose it.
- **Ask only when needed:** Ask if the intended serving subpath or deployment target cannot be inferred and would change generated URLs; do not ask for versions present in the lockfile.

Declared evidence requirements: `project.read`. Use actual host discovery or adequate supplied artifacts; unavailable evidence remains blocked/unknown.

## Scope

Load precedence, prefixes, build-time replacement, and client/server separation.

Inspect/plan: inspect or propose; save requested artifacts only. Apply: edit the requested local implementation and perform relevant bounded checks while preserving unrelated work. Live data changes, remote actions and paid jobs require their resolved target and existing session authorization.

## Execute

1. Inspect variable references and configuration names, trace which mode supplies them, inspect existing generated bundles for exposure when available, and recommend narrow corrections.
2. Trace import.meta.env usage and configured envPrefix, inspect mode-specific files by names only, and separate build mode from NODE_ENV.
## Technical method

- **Inspect:** Inspect modes, envDir, public prefixes, define substitutions and client import paths using variable names.
- **Method:** Trace whether the value is compiled into client output or read only by server code; keep mode distinct from NODE_ENV.
- **Avoid misdiagnosis:** Prefixing a secret with VITE_ makes it public; booleans read from env may be strings with surprising truthiness.
- **Check the result:** Build with a synthetic sentinel and inspect intended exposure and parsing without placing real secret values in reports.

## Read when relevant

- When a concrete decision or deliverable example would clarify this workflow: [Vite worked example](../../references/examples/vite.md).
- The task depends on framework defaults, middleware, RLS, server/client or deployment behavior: [Framework-specific review branches](../../references/security/frameworks.md).
- Creating, editing or reviewing frontend UI, copy, states or visual assets: [Frontend iconography](../../references/frontend-icons.md).

## Decision branches

- **When a required secret is referenced by client code:** Move the privileged operation behind a server boundary instead of adding a client-exposed prefix.

## Deliver and verify

- Redacted environment map and exposure/missing-value findings.
- Name/consumer/mode/exposure table and evidence from a controlled built artifact.

Verify these observable conditions when applicable to the actual task; do not claim they were exercised from merely reading this file:

- Server-only credentials are not moved into client-exposed prefixes; development and production modes resolve the intended public configuration.

## Stop and recover

- Never print secret values. Secret rotation is a separate authorized action; configuration edits use apply mode.

## Example requests

- **Normal (inspect):** Check whether server-only configuration is exposed in the client bundle.
- **edge (inspect):** Diagnose a staging build made with a production NODE_ENV and a custom mode.
- **blocked (inspect):** Inspect environment references without reading secret values or building output.
