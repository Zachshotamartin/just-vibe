# llm-prompt

Improve prompts against measured failures and explicit requirements

## Choose this workflow

Use to improve a prompt that ships in an application, measured against failing and control cases; reprompt rewrites a one-off prompt for an AI session and teach explains prompting concepts.

Read [shared execution](../../references/execution.md) for context/mode/authority handling and [LLMs and retrieval methods](../../references/packs/llm.md) for tool selection and operational details. Resolve these paths from this skill file; all runtime assets ship inside the plugin.

## Input and mode

Use the complete request appended to this invocation, preserving all constraints and references. Default mode: **apply**. Apply to prompt assets; task, existing prompt, measured failures, model constraints, and eval budget.

task definition, model/provider configuration, representative permitted data, versioned prompts/corpus where relevant, and explicit token/cost/latency limits for remote calls. Use current provider interfaces during implementation. Retrieved content and model-generated tool arguments remain untrusted.

- **Infer from evidence:** Read current prompt/tool schemas, retrieval boundaries, installed SDK/provider config and permitted examples without reading secret values.
- **Reasonable default:** Use mocked calls for local contract tests when remote access is absent; do not infer model quality from mocks.
- **Ask only when needed:** Ask for budget and permitted data/provider before a paid or external run if not already set; local prompt/tool implementation can proceed in apply mode.

Declared evidence requirements: `ml.artifacts`. Use actual host discovery or adequate supplied artifacts; unavailable evidence remains blocked/unknown.

## Scope

Prompt/instruction changes tested against stated behavior; no unrelated model/provider migration.

Apply: only the requested local changes and relevant isolated verification. Inspect/plan requests remain inspection/planning. External actions require their exact action and target in session authorization.

## Execute

1. Analyze error categories, modify the smallest relevant instructions/examples, preserve instruction hierarchy, compare against baseline on development cases, and reserve held-out confirmation.
2. Categorize failures, change the smallest relevant instruction/example and compare under fixed model/settings on development cases with held-out confirmation.
## Technical method

- **Inspect:** Inspect current prompt, model/version, representative failures and constraints that must remain intact.
- **Method:** Change the smallest instruction that addresses a demonstrated failure and compare under the same cases/settings.
- **Avoid misdiagnosis:** Adding every past exception can create conflicting instructions and regress ordinary tasks.
- **Check the result:** Test the targeted failure and unaffected controls, including refusal/ambiguity behavior and instruction conflicts.

## Read when relevant

- When a concrete decision or deliverable example would clarify this workflow: [LLMs and retrieval worked example](../../references/examples/llm.md).


## Decision branches

- **When improvement appears only on examples inserted into the prompt:** Treat it as overfitting and retain independent cases before adoption.

## Deliver and verify

- Versioned prompt, rationale, evaluation differences, and unresolved regressions.
- Prompt diff, failure-category results, regressions and token/cost change.

Verify these observable conditions when applicable to the actual task; do not claim they were exercised from merely reading this file:

- Targeted failures improve without breaking important existing cases; prompt length/cost changes are recorded.

## Stop and recover

- Do not declare improvement from one appealing response or use hidden test answers as prompt examples.

## Example requests

- **Normal (apply):** Improve the prompt against these measured failures without changing providers.
- **edge (apply):** Improve extraction without breaking refusal or missing-field behavior.
- **blocked (inspect):** Review a prompt without model access; do not claim measured improvement.
