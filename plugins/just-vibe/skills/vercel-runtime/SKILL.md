# vercel-runtime

Investigate function errors, timeouts, and runtime differences

## Choose this workflow

Use for failures after a successful build; vercel-build-fix handles build-time errors.

Read [shared execution](../../references/execution.md) for context/mode/authority handling and [Vercel methods](../../references/packs/vercel.md) for tool selection and operational details. Resolve these paths from this skill file; all runtime assets ship inside the plugin.

## Input and mode

Use the complete request appended to this invocation, preserving all constraints and references. Default mode: **inspect**. Inspect; deployment, route/function, error window, and correlation IDs. Apply for requested remediation.

exact team/project/environment and deployment/revision when applicable; read access to relevant configuration/logs. Verify installed CLI/API support and framework behavior during implementation. Never print environment values or infer promotion authorization from a preview request.

- **Infer from evidence:** Read the linked project, team, framework, environment and deployment SHA from local config and supplied deployment evidence.
- **Reasonable default:** Diagnose locally with existing build scripts when deployment access is missing; do not infer a production target from a preview URL.
- **Ask only when needed:** Resolve a missing deployment/team/environment before the dependent remote operation; names and scope suffice without exposing environment values.

Declared evidence requirements: `vercel.context`. Use actual host discovery or adequate supplied artifacts; unavailable evidence remains blocked/unknown.

## Scope

Runtime exceptions, timeouts, resource limits, and local/deployed behavior differences.

Inspect/plan: inspect or propose; save requested artifacts only. Apply: edit the requested local implementation and perform relevant bounded checks while preserving unrelated work. Live data changes, remote actions and paid jobs require their resolved target and existing session authorization.

## Execute

1. Correlate logs with revision/runtime, inspect request and dependency boundaries, separate cold-start/resource/network causes, and propose a focused reproduction or fix.
2. Correlate deployment/request/time and inspect handler entry, environment presence, dependency waits and runtime-specific API support.
3. Use the matching bundled evidence collector when available; read its result and limitations rather than treating exit zero as readiness. Revalidate identity before a dependent action.
## Technical method

- **Inspect:** Inspect function logs and request IDs with region, runtime, payload size, duration and dependency timing.
- **Method:** Separate cold start, handler CPU, downstream wait and connection acquisition; compare runtime APIs to the deployed function type.
- **Avoid misdiagnosis:** A successful build proves no request health; an Edge/Node API mismatch needs a supported runtime choice, not suppressed errors.
- **Check the result:** Exercise the original failing route with a controlled request and observe success/error/timeout behavior on the same deployment.

## Read when relevant

- When a concrete decision or deliverable example would clarify this workflow: [Vercel worked example](../../references/examples/vercel.md).
- Resolving check, deployment or migration identity: [Delivery evidence](../../references/scenarios/delivery-evidence.md).

## Decision branches

- **When timeout logs contain no downstream completion:** Treat the waiting boundary as evidence, not proof of which dependency caused the delay.

## Deliver and verify

- Supported diagnosis, relevant log references, and repair/verification steps.
- Request/deployment identity, causal hypotheses, discriminating probe and recovery limits.

Verify these observable conditions when applicable to the actual task; do not claim they were exercised from merely reading this file:

- Build success is not mistaken for runtime health; a timeout has evidence identifying the waiting boundary.

## Stop and recover

- Do not trigger billable/high-volume traffic or expose request data. Change code or configuration only in apply mode for requested remediation.

## Example requests

- **Normal (inspect):** Investigate function timeouts for this deployment and time window.
- **edge (inspect):** Diagnose a function that builds but times out awaiting a database connection.
- **blocked (inspect):** Analyze redacted runtime logs without generating live traffic.
