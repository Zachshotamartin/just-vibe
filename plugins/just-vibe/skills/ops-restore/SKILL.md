# ops-restore

Prepare or validate backup restoration in an appropriate environment

## Choose this workflow

Use for a scoped backup recovery plan or rehearsal; db-migrate changes schema/data intentionally.

Read [shared execution](../../references/execution.md) for context/mode/authority handling and [Operations methods](../../references/packs/operations.md) for tool selection and operational details. Resolve these paths from this skill file; all runtime assets ship inside the plugin.

## Input and mode

Use the complete request appended to this invocation, preserving all constraints and references. Default mode: **plan**. Plan; backup identity, source system, isolated destination, recovery objectives, and encryption/access prerequisites.

exact service/environment, time window, revision/configuration identity, authorized logs/metrics, and operational constraints. Prefer observation before intervention; live restarts, traffic changes, restores, and notifications require the requested target/action. Redact sensitive telemetry.

- **Infer from evidence:** Read service/environment, time window, revision, available telemetry and existing incident or recovery procedure.
- **Reasonable default:** Start from supplied logs and read-only observation; rank hypotheses without presenting an unexecuted intervention as recovery.
- **Ask only when needed:** Resolve the precise target and missing authority before restart, restore, notification or traffic changes; continue evidence analysis while waiting.

Declared evidence requirements: `project.read`. Use actual host discovery or adequate supplied artifacts; unavailable evidence remains blocked/unknown.

## Scope

Validate restoration and readiness; production replacement requires exact explicit authorization.

No source changes in inspect/plan. Save only requested planning artifacts. A separately requested repair uses the relevant implementation workflow.

## Execute

1. Verify backup provenance/completeness, plan target isolation, execute authorized restore, check schema/counts/integrity and application behavior, and record recovery duration/data loss window.
2. Verify backup identity, completeness, keys and destination isolation, then reconcile schema, counts, integrity and application behavior after authorized restoration.
## Technical method

- **Inspect:** Resolve backup identity, encryption access, retention, destination isolation and recovery objectives.
- **Method:** Restore into a verified separate target and validate schema, membership, constraints and application behavior.
- **Avoid misdiagnosis:** A readable archive or backup job success does not prove restoration; testing on production can overwrite current data.
- **Check the result:** Measure restored data cutoff and elapsed recovery, verify integrity and application checks, and retain the failed-step recovery plan.

## Read when relevant

- When a concrete decision or deliverable example would clarify this workflow: [Operations worked example](../../references/examples/operations.md).


## Decision branches

- **When backup reads successfully but application checks fail:** Treat recovery as incomplete and preserve the isolated target for diagnosis; do not overwrite the live source.

## Deliver and verify

- Restore procedure or exercise report with verified recovery evidence and limitations.
- Source/target identities, recovery timing/data-loss window and integrity/application results.

Verify these observable conditions when applicable to the actual task; do not claim they were exercised from merely reading this file:

- Restore succeeds into the intended isolated destination; a readable backup alone does not count as demonstrated recoverability.

## Stop and recover

- Never overwrite live data implicitly. Missing keys, integrity checks, or target identity stops execution before destructive steps.

## Example requests

- **Normal (plan):** Plan restoring the specified backup into an isolated target, not production.
- **edge (plan):** Rehearse restore into an isolated database with missing recent transactions.
- **blocked (inspect):** Plan restore with missing decryption keys or an ambiguous destination; do not execute.
