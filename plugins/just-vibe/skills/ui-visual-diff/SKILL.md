# ui-visual-diff

Compare screenshots against an accepted reference

## Choose this workflow

Use to compare matched visual states; match closes gaps against an accepted reference, and ui-audit judges usability of the resulting interface.

Read [shared execution](../../references/execution.md) for context/mode/authority handling and [UI and frontend methods](../../references/packs/ui.md) for tool selection and operational details. Resolve these paths from this skill file; all runtime assets ship inside the plugin.

## Input and mode

Use the complete request appended to this invocation, preserving all constraints and references. Default mode: **inspect**. Inspect existing captures; reference/current renders with matching viewport, state, data, fonts, and theme.

target screens/flows, existing design conventions, and runnable UI or supplied references. Visual claims require actual renders; accessibility claims distinguish automated, keyboard, and assistive-technology evidence.

- **Infer from evidence:** Inspect the target flow, existing components/tokens, actual renders or supplied references and current responsive behavior.
- **Reasonable default:** Reuse established visual conventions and preserve keyboard behavior; label unrendered changes as visually unverified.
- **Ask only when needed:** Ask about an unresolved interaction or visual direction only when plausible choices materially differ; do not make a missing screenshot block source inspection.

Declared evidence requirements: `browser.inspect`. Use actual host discovery or adequate supplied artifacts; unavailable evidence remains blocked/unknown.

## Scope

Visual differences and regression classification; match applies visual fixes.

No source changes in inspect/plan. Save only requested planning artifacts. A separately requested repair uses the relevant implementation workflow.

## Execute

1. Normalize capture conditions, identify meaningful regions, separate dynamic content noise, and describe differences by user impact.
2. Match viewport, DPR, fonts, content, theme and animation state; mask only justified nondeterminism and inspect changed regions before accepting baselines.
## Technical method

- **Inspect:** Record baseline approval, viewport, fonts, data, time and screenshot environment.
- **Method:** Compare matched states, separating rendering noise from layout/content changes; inspect differences before replacing a baseline.
- **Avoid misdiagnosis:** Approving a new screenshot merely because it differs converts a regression into the expected result.
- **Check the result:** Reproduce significant differences with stable fonts/data and retain both images plus a reason for accepted changes.

## Read when relevant

- When a concrete decision or deliverable example would clarify this workflow: [UI and frontend worked example](../../references/examples/ui.md).
- Creating, editing or reviewing frontend UI, copy, states or visual assets: [Frontend iconography](../../references/frontend-icons.md).
- The affected project uses Flutter: [Flutter](../../references/frameworks/flutter.md).
- The affected project uses React Native / Expo: [React Native / Expo](../../references/frameworks/react-native.md).
- The task specifically involves gsap, motion design, framer motion, view transition, click path; load only the matching method: [Motion, visual direction and click paths](../../references/methods/motion-design.md).

## Decision branches

- **When captures differ in environment or content:** Recreate comparable captures or give qualitative differences without a precise pixel claim.

## Deliver and verify

- Compared images or annotated difference report with conditions and confidence.
- Capture conditions, changed regions, accepted differences and remaining mismatches.

Verify these observable conditions when applicable to the actual task; do not claim they were exercised from merely reading this file:

- A layout shift is detected; a timestamp-only change is not misclassified as a design regression.

## Stop and recover

- Capturing a local build is bounded local execution; capturing a shared or remote target needs that target in scope. Unmatched conditions invalidate precise pixel-difference claims.

## Example requests

- **Normal (inspect):** Compare these matched-viewport screenshots and separate dynamic noise from regressions.
- **edge (inspect):** Compare screenshots with dynamic timestamps and a real layout shift.
- **blocked (inspect):** Compare supplied captures with unknown font loading; do not assert exact pixel fidelity.
