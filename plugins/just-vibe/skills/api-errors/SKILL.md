# api-errors

Standardize useful error responses and propagation.

## Choose this workflow

Use to standardize error behavior without changing business policy; api-design defines a new contract.

Read [shared execution](../../references/execution.md) for context/mode/authority handling and [APIs methods](../../references/packs/api.md) for tool selection and operational details. Resolve these paths from this skill file; all runtime assets ship inside the plugin.

## Input and mode

Use the complete request appended to this invocation, preserving all constraints and references. Default mode: **apply**. Apply; API scope, current error format, consumers, and logging requirements.

**Pack prerequisites:** Interface definitions, producer/consumer source, authentication model, versioning constraints, and isolated test endpoints. External API calls must respect environment, credentials, rate limits, and side-effect scope.

- **Infer from evidence:** Read producer/consumer schemas, error contracts, auth conventions and known supported client versions.
- **Reasonable default:** Keep compatible response and pagination semantics where the brief does not request a breaking change.
- **Ask only when needed:** Ask when contract sources disagree or an unknown consumer changes compatibility; do not require live credentials to write or test an isolated client.

Declared evidence requirements: `project.read`. Use actual host discovery or adequate supplied artifacts; unavailable evidence remains blocked/unknown.

## Scope

Error status, machine-readable codes, safe messages, propagation, and trace correlation.

Apply: only the requested local changes and relevant isolated verification. Inspect/plan requests remain inspection/planning. External actions require their exact action and target in session authorization.

## Execute

1. Inventory errors, preserve required compatibility, map domain failures deliberately, redact internals, and test representative client/server failures.
2. Inventory existing client-visible codes and shapes, map domain failures intentionally and preserve safe correlation IDs while redacting internal details.

## Technical method

- **Inspect:** Inventory exception sources, status semantics, domain codes, request IDs and retry behavior.
- **Method:** Map expected domain failures to stable public errors; redact internal details while retaining correlated server diagnostics.
- **Avoid misdiagnosis:** Returning 200 with an error-shaped body or retryable status for a permanent denial misleads clients.
- **Check the result:** Exercise invalid input, forbidden resource, dependency timeout and unexpected exception; verify public redaction and useful internal correlation.

## Read when relevant

- When a concrete decision or deliverable example would clarify this workflow: [APIs worked example](../../references/examples/api.md).
- The affected project uses Django / DRF: [Django / DRF](../../references/frameworks/django.md).
- The affected project uses FastAPI: [FastAPI](../../references/frameworks/fastapi.md).
- The affected project uses Spring Boot: [Spring Boot](../../references/frameworks/spring-boot.md).

## Decision branches

- **When changing a code would break a known consumer:** Add a compatibility path or a versioned transition instead of silently normalizing it.

## Deliver and verify

- Consistent error handling, documented contract, and checks.
- Error taxonomy, mapping locations and validation/auth/dependency failure cases.

Verify these observable conditions when applicable to the actual task; do not claim they were exercised from merely reading this file:

- Validation errors identify usable field problems; unexpected failures do not leak stack traces or credentials.

## Stop and recover

- Do not turn all failures into success responses or change public codes silently. Unknown consumer reliance needs compatibility handling.

## Example requests

- **Normal (apply):** Standardize safe API errors while preserving published machine-readable codes.
- **Edge (apply):** Standardize errors while preserving a client's retry behavior on conflict.
- **Blocked (inspect):** Review errors from source without provoking real service failures.
