# ml-calibrate

Assess predicted probabilities against observed outcomes

## Choose this workflow

Use to assess or fit probability calibration; ml-threshold maps scores to decisions.

Read [shared execution](../../references/execution.md) for context/mode/authority handling and [ML evaluation methods](../../references/packs/ml-evaluation.md) for tool selection and operational details. Resolve these paths from this skill file; all runtime assets ship inside the plugin.

## Input and mode

Use the complete request appended to this invocation, preserving all constraints and references. Default mode: **inspect**. Inspect; predicted probabilities, labels, sampling/prevalence context, and intended use. Apply to fit a calibrator on a permitted split when requested.

frozen model/artifact, evaluation dataset identity, labels where needed, metric definitions, and task/operating context. Report sample counts and uncertainty appropriate to dependencies; avoid repeated test-set tuning. Exploratory findings need fresh confirmation before strong generalization claims.

- **Infer from evidence:** Read frozen model/data identities, metric definitions, denominators and supplied predictions; separate validation from test use.
- **Reasonable default:** Compute only supported metrics on permitted samples and label missing labels or subgroup coverage as unknown.
- **Ask only when needed:** Ask when the operating cost/threshold or population changes the evaluation decision; do not fabricate labels to avoid a question.

Declared evidence requirements: `ml.artifacts`. Use actual host discovery or adequate supplied artifacts; unavailable evidence remains blocked/unknown.

## Scope

Probability reliability assessment; fitting a calibrator uses a separate held-out calibration protocol in apply mode.

Inspect/plan: inspect or propose; save requested artifacts only. Apply: make the requested changes or execute the requested operation within its resolved target and limits. Local preparation does not authorize live, remote, destructive or paid actions; existing explicit session authorization still applies.

## Execute

1. Validate probability semantics, inspect reliability by range/cohort, use appropriate scoring measures, and compare any fitted calibrator on untouched evaluation data.
2. Check probability semantics, reliability and proper scoring measures; fit any calibrator on permitted data separate from final evaluation and compare by cohort.
## Technical method

- **Inspect:** Inspect probability outputs, class definition, prevalence, selection split and calibration metric/binning.
- **Method:** Fit calibration on permitted selection data and evaluate reliability on separate data; compare proper scoring rules and reliability curves.
- **Avoid misdiagnosis:** Ranking quality does not imply probability accuracy; coarse bins or shifted prevalence can conceal miscalibration.
- **Check the result:** Check perfect, constant and confidently wrong synthetic predictions, then evaluate held-out calibration with sample support per region.

## Read when relevant

- When a concrete decision or deliverable example would clarify this workflow: [ML evaluation worked example](../../references/examples/ml-evaluation.md).
- The task specifically involves pytorch, autograd, ddp, cuda mismatch; load only the matching method: [PyTorch autograd, device and distributed debugging](../../references/methods/pytorch-debug.md).
- The task specifically involves recommender, ranking metrics, retrieval ranking, ml adoption; load only the matching method: [Retrieval, ranking and recommendation evaluation](../../references/methods/recommender-systems.md).

## Decision branches

- **When prevalence or sampling changed since calibration:** Assess transfer assumptions and recalibration evidence without claiming ranking quality proves reliable probabilities.

## Deliver and verify

- Calibration report or calibrated artifact with split provenance and checks.
- Calibration protocol, reliability evidence and independent comparison.

Verify these observable conditions when applicable to the actual task; do not claim they were exercised from merely reading this file:

- Good ranking is not mistaken for calibrated probability; fitting and evaluating a calibrator on identical records is rejected.

## Stop and recover

- Small samples and prevalence shift limit conclusions. Do not alter deployed probabilities without a rollout request.

## Example requests

- **Normal (inspect):** Assess probability calibration from the supplied held-out scores and outcomes.
- **edge (apply):** Calibrate a model trained on oversampled positives.
- **blocked (inspect):** Review probability outputs with too few outcomes to fit a reliable calibrator.
