# llm-injection

Test handling of hostile instructions in untrusted content.

## Choose this workflow

Use for scoped instruction-boundary evaluation; security-inputs handles interpreter injection.

Read [shared execution](../../references/execution.md) for context/mode/authority handling and [LLMs and retrieval methods](../../references/packs/llm.md) for tool selection and operational details. Resolve these paths from this skill file; all runtime assets ship inside the plugin.

## Input and mode

Use the complete request appended to this invocation, preserving all constraints and references. Default mode: **plan**. Plan; agent workflow, untrusted input surfaces, trust boundaries, and isolated test scope. Apply for requested canary test fixtures or bounded isolated runs.

**Pack prerequisites:** Task definition, model/provider configuration, representative permitted data, versioned prompts/corpus where relevant, and explicit token/cost/latency limits for remote calls. Use current provider interfaces during implementation. Retrieved content and model-generated tool arguments remain untrusted.

- **Infer from evidence:** Read current prompt/tool schemas, retrieval boundaries, installed SDK/provider config and permitted examples without reading secret values.
- **Reasonable default:** Use mocked calls for local contract tests when remote access is absent; do not infer model quality from mocks.
- **Ask only when needed:** Ask for budget and permitted data/provider before a paid or external run if not already set; local prompt/tool implementation can proceed in apply mode.

Resolve any task-specific tools, target identity and evidence before dependent actions. No external connection is assumed.

## Scope

Defensive tests for hostile instructions in retrieved documents, logs, messages, and tool output.

Inspect/plan: inspect or propose; save requested artifacts only. Apply: make the requested changes or execute the requested operation within its resolved target and limits. Local preparation does not authorize live, remote, destructive or paid actions; existing explicit session authorization still applies.

## Execute

1. Map data-to-authority boundaries, create benign canary scenarios, run isolated tests in apply mode, inspect tool actions as well as text, and propose enforceable mitigations.
2. Map untrusted documents and tool results into model context, plant benign canaries and inspect tool actions as well as generated text.

## Technical method

- **Inspect:** Identify untrusted surfaces, sensitive capabilities, instruction boundaries and observable tool-call logs.
- **Method:** Use synthetic canaries and harmless target changes to test direct/indirect injection; enforce trust and permission boundaries outside generated text.
- **Avoid misdiagnosis:** A refusal in the final response does not prove no unsafe tool call occurred; keyword blocking is not a general defense.
- **Check the result:** Inspect attempted calls, retrieved context and output for canary exposure; include benign quoted instructions as a false-positive control.

## Read when relevant

- When a concrete decision or deliverable example would clarify this workflow: [LLMs and retrieval worked example](../../references/examples/llm.md).


## Decision branches

- **When an attack is blocked in one finite fixture:** Report the tested boundary and remaining coverage; do not claim universal prompt-injection immunity.

## Deliver and verify

- Test cases, observed failures, mitigations, and residual limitations.
- Attack surface, canary cases, observed actions and enforceable mitigations.

Verify these observable conditions when applicable to the actual task; do not claim they were exercised from merely reading this file:

- A retrieved instruction cannot redirect secrets to a canary destination; legitimate quoted instructions remain usable as data.

## Stop and recover

- Never exfiltrate real secrets or probe third-party systems. Passing a finite suite does not establish universal immunity.

## Example requests

- **Normal (plan):** Plan isolated prompt-injection tests using benign canaries and no real secrets.
- **Edge (apply):** Test a retrieved document asking the agent to send a synthetic secret elsewhere.
- **Blocked (inspect):** Design canary tests without real secrets or external exfiltration endpoints.
